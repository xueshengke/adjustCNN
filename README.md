This project attemps to train a convolutional neural network through sigmoid activation function defined with adjustable parameters, alpha and beta.

\begin{equation}
	a = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-u)}, \textrm{where} \ u = \alpha x + \beta.
\end{equation}

Due to they are learnable, backpropagation rule is also appliable on them, $\frac{\partial E}{\partial \alpha}$ and $\frac{\partial E}{\partial \beta}$.

Nevertheless, the results are not promising, which are not intelligent enough.
